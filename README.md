# Patrisha - the Discord Bot

**Patrisha** is a Discord Bot that does all sorts of stuff. It is still an ongoing project, so it's not fully featured yet (you could say she's in alpha development right now) however, there is a plethora of commands at your disposal (listed below).

*If you have any feedback and/or suggestions, DM me at Trishma#6911 over on Discord.*

# List of available commands

These are structured in the following format:  
!{subgroup (if available)} \[alias1, alias2...] <argument 1> <argument 2> <optional_argument=default value>
